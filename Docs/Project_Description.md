# Project Description

The **VIT Clubs & Chapters Management System** was created in Figma to simplify how student clubs at VIT manage their work.  

### Key Modules
- **Login & Profiles** – secure access for students/admins
- **Upcoming Events** – schedule and manage events
- **Groups** – create groups, add/remove members
- **Announcements** – post important updates
- **Chat Box** – real-time communication
- **Achievements** – record milestones of clubs and members

### Why This Project?
Managing multiple clubs in a university often leads to scattered WhatsApp groups and Excel sheets. This design centralizes everything in a single platform.
